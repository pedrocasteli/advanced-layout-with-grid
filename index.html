            <h2>A Shifting Reef</h2>
            <p>
              The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a
              mysterious and puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet
              forgotten. Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime
              population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of
              continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants,
              common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and
              America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of
              several states on the two continents, were deeply interested in
              the matter.

              <h2>I Form My Resolution</h2>
              <p>
                Three seconds before the arrival of J. B. Hobson’s letter, I no
                more thought of pursuing the unicorn than of attempting the
                passage of the North Sea. Three seconds after reading the letter
                of the honourable Secretary of Marine, I felt that my true
                vocation, the sole end of my life, was to chase this disturbing
                monster, and purge it from the world.

              <h2>The Man of the Seas</h2>
              <p>
                It was the commander of the vessel who thus spoke. At these
                words, Ned Land rose suddenly. The steward, nearly strangled,
                tottered out on a sign from his master; but such was the power
                of the commander on board, that not a gesture betrayed the
                resentment which this man must have felt towards the Canadian.

              <h2>At Full Steam</h2>
              <p>
                At this cry the whole ship’s crew hurried towards the
                harpooner,—commander, officers, masters, sailors, cabin boys;
                even the engineers left their engines, and the stokers their
                furnaces. The order to stop her had been given, and the frigate
                now simply went on by her own momentum.

              Ned Land was a Canadian, with an uncommon quickness of hand, and
              who knew no equal in his dangerous occupation. Skill, coolness,
              audacity, and cunning he possessed in a superior degree, and it
              must be a cunning whale or a singularly “cute” cachalot to escape
              the stroke of his harpoon.

            <p>
              Captain Farragut was a good seaman, worthy of the frigate he
              commanded. His vessel and he were one. He was the soul of it. On
              the question of the cetacean there was no doubt in his mind, and
              he would not allow the existence of the animal to be disputed on
              board.

            <p>
              Commander Farragut, desirous of seeing Ned Land at work, gave him
              permission to go on board the Monroe. And fate served our Canadian
              so well that, instead of one whale, he harpooned two with a double
              blow, striking one straight to the heart, and catching the other
              after some minutes’ pursuit.
