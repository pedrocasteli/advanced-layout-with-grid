          <h1>A Shifting Reef</h1>
          <p>
            The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious
            and puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten.
            Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and
            excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents,
            seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors,
            captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval
            officers of all countries, and the Governments of several states on
            the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter.
          </p>

          <p>
            For some time past, vessels had been met by “an enormous thing,” a
            long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and
            infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.
          </p>

          <p>
            The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books)
            agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in
            question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising
            power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed
            endowed. If it was a cetacean, it surpassed in size all those
            hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean
            of observations made at divers times,—rejecting the timid estimate
            of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet,
            equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in
            width and three in length,—we might fairly conclude that this
            mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the
            ichthyologists of the day, if it existed at all. And that it did
            exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which disposes
            the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the
            excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural
            apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was
            out of the question.
